    <h1>How Sequential Phragmén voting works</h1>

    <p>This is an <a href="https://explorabl.es/">explorable explanation</a> of the Sequential <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lars_Edvard_Phragm%C3%A9n">Phragmén voting system</a> (invented in the 1890s) currently used on <a href="http://kusama.network">Kusama</a> and <a href="http://polkadot.network">Polkadot's</a> on-chain elections. You can modify these examples - create candidates and voters, adjust their voting stake (drag left and right or type) and add and delete votes to see how it affects the results.</p>

    <p>This voting system is used for nominators to elect validators, as well as for the community to carry out council elections and referendums.</p>

    <h2>Example 1 <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-phragmen">(from the Polkadot Wiki)</a></h2>
    
    <p>
      A simple example with 1 token per voter, with three candidates
      to elect out of four. As you would expect the candidates with
      the most votes (and tokens backing them) get elected. The
      process is an iterative one, each candidate is selected in a
      different 'round' of the election process, this is the number
      displayed in the elected column.

    <h2>Example 2 <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-phragmen">(from the Polkadot Wiki)</a></h2>

    <p>
      The problem with having voters associated with accounts is that
      one person can control many hundreds of accounts, or a single
      account may indeed be owned by multiple people - there is no way
      (currently) to know this. Instead the concept is that the people
      with the most to lose (the highest amount of tokens) are given
      the most power - voters need to temporarily reserve some of
      their tokens to weight their voting. It of course comes with
      it's own problems, and it is acknowledged that the power of large
      stakeholders needs to be limited. We'll see in later examples
      how Phragmén voting as applied in Polkadot and Kusama tackles
      this in a couple of ways.
    <p>
    
    <p>
      Here we see some voters with different stake amounts. The
      candidates with the highest stakes backing them get elected -
      but this doesn't always match the vote share. Try changing the
      stakes to see how it effects the election.

    <h2>Example 3: Sometimes the stake is out voted</h2>

    <p>
      There is more to Phragmén voting than simply ordering candidates
      by the amount of tokens backing them. In this example we see
      some of the intermediate calculations (called voter 'load' and
      candidate 'scores') which change for each round of the election
      process.
    </p>

    <p>
      With loads and scores the smaller the number the better, as it's
      the candidate with the <i>lowest score</i> in each round that
      gets
      elected. The <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-phragmen">Polkadot
      wiki</a> has more detail on how they are calculated which I'm
      not going to go into here - we are interested in the effect they
      have on the results.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      In a manner of speaking, the loads and scores redistribute 'success'
      between voters. Each time one of your chosen candidates is
      elected in a round, your voter load is increased for all the
      subsequent rounds. As this number increases, it reduces the
      influence of your votes on the candidate scores. We can see below a
      case where a candidate with a large stake loses out to one with
      a lower stake - because the voters that chose it were boosted,
      as they haven't had any other candidates selected.

    <h2>Example 4: Voter conviction</h2>

    <p>
      Another aspect that evens the playing field with regard to
      large stakeholders is to allow people to trade brute force "deep pockets"
      for time, using a <i>conviction</i> parameter. This allows voters to lock
      their voting tokens for longer, which multiplies their stake up to six times.
    </p>

    <p>
      It's important to note that tokens locked for voting can be used
      for other things at the same time, other votes, staking, locked
      for setting on-chain identity for example. They just can't be
      moved to another account during the this time.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The two colour circles below show the effect of the conviction
      on the stake, with the darker pink representing the final
      multiplied amount for each candidate (which can be smaller if
      the 0.1x conviction is used).
